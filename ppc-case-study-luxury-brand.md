## 🛠️ My Approach

### ✅ Campaign Audit & Segmentation
- Broke down existing campaigns by match type (Exact, Phrase, Broad)
- Separated branded vs. non-branded keywords
- Used Sponsored Brands & Sponsored Display to retarget top-converting ASINs

### ✅ Keyword & Bid Optimization
- Performed in-depth keyword research using Helium 10 & Brand Analytics
- Reduced bid waste by pausing low-converting keywords
- Focused spend on proven search terms & added exact-match top performers

### ✅ Negative Targeting & Budget Reallocation

- Moved budget from underperforming campaigns to high-ROAS performers
